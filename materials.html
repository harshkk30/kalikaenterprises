        <p>A ventilator is a medical device that helps people breathe when they are unable to breathe on their own. It is commonly used in hospitals, especially in intensive care units (ICUs), to support patients with respiratory failure or other breathing problems.</p>
    
    <h2>How Ventilators Work</h2>
    
    <p>Ventilators work by delivering a mixture of oxygen and air into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide from the body. They can be set to deliver specific volumes of air or to provide breaths at a certain rate, depending on the patient's needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Ventilators</h2>
    
    <p>There are several types of ventilators, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Invasive Ventilators:</strong> These ventilators use a tube inserted into the patient's airway, typically through the mouth or nose.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Invasive Ventilators:</strong> These ventilators deliver air through a mask or other interface without the need for an artificial airway.</li>
        <li><strong>Portable Ventilators:</strong> These ventilators are designed for mobility and can be used outside of hospital settings, such as during patient transport.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Uses of Ventilators</h2>
    
    <p>Ventilators are used in various medical scenarios, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Respiratory failure due to conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>
        <li>During surgery to provide anesthesia and assist breathing.</li>
        <li>In emergency situations, such as cardiac arrest or trauma, to support breathing until the patient can breathe independently.</li>
    </ul>
